As mentioned in my previous post, the nature of my capstone is very different to other capstones in my division. Since the very nature of this capstone pertains around sexual violence, and the process will be fluid, much of my research will focus on sexual violence and not to the data analysis process. At this point I have sources ranging from academic reports to documentaries. I've captured both primary sources as well as secondary sources. My research is also spanning the recent history of how sexual violence has been handled in the United States and internationally. Recently I watched an informative documentary called *The Hunting Ground*. Not only did a get a fantastic view of how other colleges are handling sexual violence cases on campus, but I also got a perspective of numerous students around the country and what students are doing to change the current culture in the United States. I also learned about how to report a Title IX violation at a college to launch an investigation. Sources in this documentary conveniently listed with facts, which makes it very easy to find trails of research that I can investigate further.

At this point in my research, I have nine resources (four academic). Most of the material I have reviewed doesn't go into Title IX at any depth. If I'm already at nine articles that haven't even covered cases pertaining to Title IX, I can see my research going well above the minimum of ten articles. Although we have been given the next week to write Chapter 2 of our capstone, I predict that this research will be ongoing till the end of this capstone. There is too much information that I have to know about while conducting this capstone, I feel that I will never be prepared to talk about this topic with confidence. 

In addition to the ITS capstone, I will be adding information to the Professional Writing capstone proposal. Once this proposal is approved, we should be all set to set up appointments to get the "human-involved experiment" approved by the college and meet with our Title IX coordinator. Everything thus far is on schedule.

The only barriers I can see stopping us is the intensity of this topic. It's very hard to research sexual violence as most of the content is extremely upsetting. Conducting the research has been the biggest challenge and will continue to be the biggest challenge.
