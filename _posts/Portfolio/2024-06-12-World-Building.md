A true showcase of my skills in documentation coming right from the project I have aptly named The Unintentional Calamity. The image above shows a preview of Obsidian.md, the program where I keep all the information about the world of Anachronis. In total, there are six settlements, one extremely detailed city,  multiple organizations, 78 characters, multiple historical events, and so much more packed into this vault. How do I keep all of these overlapping stories and events in check? It's all due to a rigid system I've developed.

# Templates & Procedures

In order to keep metadata consistent I created templates to auto-populate the correct tags. When I whip up a new character, building, or society I have a template that will put in the placeholder tags needed. All I have to do is make a couple of tweaks to specify the planet, continent, type or thing I'm creating and I can immediately start writing. The image above shows one of many characters I've made. The table at the top of the document comes pre-made, only leaving the spaces I need to fill out important details such as strengths and weaknesses.

In the bottom left you can see a search bar. When every document is properly tagged, I can easily search for all characters located in a specific place or book. The more tags I add the more I can slim down search results.

On the top right you'll see a document specifying ages of different Dungeons and Dragons races. It can be extraordinarily hard to keep track of what race lives longer and when someone is considered an adult. Having that specific file up at all times is enormously helpful.

Conspicuously in the bottom right is a graph. If you hover over each "dot" you'll find the name of a document connected to this one through (essentially) Wiki links. Obsidian.md supports linking documents, so it's easy to keep track of when one document is mentioned in another place. This also helps minimize duplicate information. For every underlined piece of text you can see in this preview, there is a link to an entire other document.

# Organization System

Often times it can be hard to decide how detailed a document should be. There are different organization systems out there that promote different levels of details that should be included. Over time I've come to the conclusion that this project benefits from small documents giving very specific details (similar to how functions are made within a program). No one document should go on for very long. If you need to link a bunch of information into one place, make a document dedicated to linking similar details to that one document!

That is exactly what is shown in the screenshot above. The document "Plate 5 Amenities"  is a linking document explaining what characters, public buildings, shops, and secret buildings are associated with that part of the city. Very little information is actually kept in this document. If I want more information, I can simply click into the linked document. See Fade Moya, she's mentioned in this document but there is far less information on her in here than what was shown in the previous section.

This system of preferring linking over large documents with many parts to them has helped keep duplicate information down to a minimum and makes linking documents much easier, as I don't have to link to specific headers. There are other benefits to this method as well such as dynamic links automatically updating a renamed file. In other words, if I change Fade Moya's name (which is the name of the document) it changes throughout every file that links to hers!

# Conclusion

With 81,000 words, 221 individual files, and 40 tags outlining an entire science fiction world, I have devised a system that is extremely efficient. This project has been a great exercise in discipline, organization, and most importantly documentation. I am currently using this world to run a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and I can check information as I am running a session. This resource has been immensely valuable and is proof that I have a well run system. I am confident that this skill can help real world documentation, especially in the IT industry.
