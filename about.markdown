# Who is Gale Striker?

Officially I'm a Data Scientist interested in ethics and writing with a nack for using open source software. With my background in IT Support, I'm also able to not only analyze data, but I can build a server on which to deploy models without the use of Data Bricks or other software commonly sold to deploy machine learning models.

Unofficially, my interests vary widely. I love teaching, writing, storytelling, singing, playing video games, and hiking. The world is full of wonders and I want to see them all. I am truly the jack of all trades, master of none. This doesn't mean I can't achieve a high level of proficiency, it does mean I don't bother learning a topic in depth on my own unless it is needed. Hence my diverse skillset.

# What does a data scientist do?

I am the person who can look at a companies database and find the story behind the data. I help find answers to questions through the use of machine learning algorithms. What customers respond well to your business? What can be optimized in internal operations? Can you find anything significant in this dataset? These are the types of questions I help clients answer.

# What is this website?

This website is my portfolio. This is where I post logs of what projects I'm currently working on or update my own information so the internet can see it.

I also included my Email, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter account just in case someone wants to see my work or get in contact with me.

# Who's hosting this website?

GitHub pages! This whole website is hosted for free through GitHub pages. All my code is available [here](https://github.com/Pinemark-Gale/Pinemark-Gale.github.io) if you want to see the structure of the website. It is dynamically generated through Jekyll. I created all the HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript for this particular theme from scratch. Please feel free to email me if you would like more information on how to make a 100% free blogging website.
